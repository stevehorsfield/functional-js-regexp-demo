About
=====

This application is currently deployed at: http://functional-js-regexp-demo.herokuapp.com/reg-exp-test.html

It provides server-side regular expression parsing demonstrating an example integration of Node, Angular and
JS.

It is not intended to demonstrate idiomatic JavaScript or the most ideal implementation.  Rather, it was
developed as a learning aid and is an almost direct port of F# code described in the original blog post.
